            Rizal received his secondary education at the Ateneo Municipal of Manila,
            where he was a star pupil. On graduation from the Ateneo, he won first prizes
            in 5 academic subjects, and his bachelor of arts degree was conferred from
            Santo Tomas University (the only institution in the Philippines authorized to
            grant academic degrees.) From <b>1879</b> to <b>1882</b>, he studied medicine, agriculture,
            surveying, and <b>philosophy</b> and <b>letters</b> at <b>Santo Tomas University</b> in Manila.
            Dissatisfied with his education there, due in part to the prejudices of faculty
            against native students, he continued his studies in Spain. In <b>1884</b>, Rizal completed
            licentiates in medicine and in philosophy and letters at the Central University of Madrid.
            (The licentiate is an undergraduate degree similar to the American bachelor's degree but
            with a more vocational focus. Further medical education was not required to call oneself
            a physician or to practice medicine at that time. However, one could obtain a doctoral
            degree, similar to a contemporary American doctoral degree, after passing examinations
            and writing an approved thesis.)</p>
            
            <p class="p-text">Rizal kept meticulous notes of his clinical experiences in Madrid. His clinical and surgical
            notes contain details of lectures and case histories. The case reports include the <b>patients'
            history, physical findings, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment, including prescriptions,
            diet, course</b>, and even <b>autopsy findings</b>. Rizal recorded opinions of professors on the cases as well
            as his own observations. Some comments show his awareness of inadequacies in the system with an
            ironic sense of humor: <b>The San Carlos clinic which prints a seal of infection to every wound</b>.</p>
            
            <p class="p-text">Although Rizal completed a thesis for his doctorate in medicine, he did not technically receive this degree,
            since he did not appear to read his thesis aloud as required by the <b>Central University of Madrid</b>.
            At the time Rizal completed the thesis, he was already studying <b>ophthalmology</b> in <b>Germany</b>. Reading his
            thesis in Madrid would have required an additional trip to Spain, which Rizal could not afford. Instead,
            he mailed his thesis to the university and hoped for its acceptance in this manner.</p>
